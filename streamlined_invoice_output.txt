Despite being a big problem, the solution is easy to build with Stack AI, a generative AI workflow automation platform. In 
this guide, weʼll walk you through how to upload an invoice, process it with AI, and store it in database software for future 
reference.
Streamline invoice processing with AI
File upload input
For this guide, weʼll be using the Workflow Builder. Select the New Project to start from scratch. This option creates a 
project with 3 nodes as a base:
For this guide, we want the prompt to be an invoice file. Delete the text input by clicking the cross icon.
On the left menu, expand the Inputs section. Then, drag and drop the Files node onto the canvas.File upload input

Notice the Files node comes with the Expose as input setting activated by default. This will let your team upload files to the 
tool once you export it. Drag the Files output handle onto the OpenAIʼs LLM input handle.
Process the invoice with GPT-4o
To process the invoice, weʼll use the GPT-4o model. Due to its multimodality and vision capabilities, it can accurately 
understand images, read documents, and extract text.
The OpenAI LLM node is already on the canvas. Make sure the GPT-4o model is selected from the dropdown.5/16/25, 6:50 PM How to Streamline Invoice Processing with AI
https://www.stack-ai.com/blog/how-to-streamline-invoice-processing-with-ai 3/14

--- Page 4 ---
LLM system instructions
The model needs system instructions to understand how to process the uploaded files. Weʼve prepared a template you can 
adapt to your needs.
You are an expert document parser specialized in processing invoices. Your task is to extract key invoice details from the 
raw text or OCR output of an invoice. Be accurate, consistent, and return the data so it can be written to Airtable (follow the 
Airtable API guidelines).
Extract the following elements. If you can't find any of these, just write "null":
invoice number,
invoice date,
vendor name,
vendor email,
vendor phone,
bill to,
total amount,
currrency,
bank name,

Please note that this system prompt assumes youʼll be using Airtable as data storage and the most common elements to 
extract from an invoice. Edit these instructions according to your use case.
LLM prompt
The prompt will include a simple instruction to start running the action along with the document.
Write the following in the prompt input field:
Process this invoice:
Then, type a forward slash, bringing up all the available data inputs. Select the Files input node from the dropdown. This 
will pull the document into the prompt, making it available to GPT-4o for processing.
Save the invoice details to Airtable
For this tutorial, weʼll be storing the invoice details as a row in an Airtable base. Expand the Apps section in the left menu, 
select the Airtable app, and drag the Write to Airtable action node onto the canvas, to the right of the LLM node.5/16/25, 6:50 PM How to Streamline Invoice Processing with AI

Click the Write to Airtable node to open its settings. Click the New Connection button to begin connecting Airtable to Stack 
AI.
Follow the instructions in the pop up windows to successfully connect both platforms. Once complete, click the Test button 
to check connection health.5/16/25, 6:50 PM How to Streamline Invoice Processing with AI
https://www.stack-ai.com/blog/how-to-streamline-invoice-processing-with-ai 6/14

--- Page 7 ---
Connect the OpenAI LLM node to Write to Airtable.
This node needs to know what to write to Airtable. In the Inputs > Data section, type a forward slash in the input field and 
select the LLM node.5/16/25, 6:50 PM How to Streamline Invoice Processing with AI
https://www.stack-ai.com/blog/how-to-streamline-invoice-processing-with-ai 7/14

--- Page 8 ---
Next, we need to target the Airtable base and table to store the information. Open the Airtable base where you want to 
save processed invoice data. Fill the Base ID with the text right after the Airtable domain in the URL input of your browser.
Fill out the table name where the data should be saved. This is visible in Airtableʼs user interface. Type the exact name.
Stack AI and Airtable are now properly connected and ready to transfer data.
Clean the output for a better user 
experience
At this point, youʼve built the core functionality of the tool. However, when running, your users will see a snippet of JSON 
(JavaScript Object Notation, a notation system for safe and accurate data transmission between machines). Letʼs improve 
user experience by providing a message indicating whether the action completed successfully or not.
Expand the LLMs section. Drag and drop another OpenAI node onto the canvas, to the right of the Write to Airtable node.5/16/25, 6:50 PM How to Streamline Invoice Processing with AI

Connect the Write to Airtable action to the new OpenAI LLM.
The GPT-4o Mini model is a good match for this task, as it doesnʼt require a high level of intelligence. Use these system 
instructions as a template to interpret the output of the Write to Airtable action.
You're a message formatter.
If the user message has any content, format it in a list format to show that an invoice was successfully saved.
If the user message has no content, state that there was an error while saving the invoice.5/16/25, 6:50 PM How to Streamline Invoice Processing with AI

Then, type a forward slash to open the data sources dropdown. Add the Write to Airtable (Record ID). Repeat the process 
to add the Write to Airtable (Fields) data.
Connect this LLM to the output. Its response will be exposed to the user, letting them know the status of the processing
